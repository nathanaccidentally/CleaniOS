# CleaniOS
A tiny tweak that fixes some of my iOS 10 annoyances such as the little Siri icon on the bottom of the lock screen and the page dots on the SpringBoard. I know other tweaks can accomplish this but they are usually pretty big tweaks that can slow down my old 5S.

Anyways, do whatever you want with the code.
